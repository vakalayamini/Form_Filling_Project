# Voice-Based Form Filling 

This is a Flask-based web application that leverages OpenAI's Whisper model for transcribing audio input to text. The app enables users to complete forms using voice input by processing audio files, extracting transcriptions, and mapping the text to form fields.  

The application includes user authentication (signup and login pages), a home page, and a registration form page.

### Workflow

1. **Signup**: After the user submits their signup details, the system checks if the provided email is already present in the database.
   - If the email exists, the user is redirected to the signup page.
   - If the email doesn't exist, the user is redirected to the login page.

2. **Login**: When the user tries to log in:
   - If the credentials are incorrect, the user is redirected back to the login page to try again.
   - If the credentials are correct, the student registration form opens for the user to fill out.

3. **Student Registration Form**: 
   - After filling out the student registration form, the system checks if all details are valid.
   - If the form is valid, the user is redirected to the home page.
   - If the form is invalid or incomplete, the user is redirected back to the form page to correct the errors.
